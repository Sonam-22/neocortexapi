# ML22/23-4 Investigate and Implement SDR Classifier - Team-Lightening - Azure Cloud Implementation

## I. Software Engineering Project Description

### Software Engineering Project : [Code](https://github.com/Sonam-22/neocortexapi/tree/team-lightening/source/MySEProject) & [Paper](https://github.com/Sonam-22/neocortexapi/blob/team-lightening/source/MySEProject/Documentation/SDR-Classifier.pdf)

The Hierarchical Temporal Memory (HTM) model has evolved as a result of advancements in Artificial Neural Networks, which have also improved the Cortical Learning Algorithm (CLA) classifier. This development led to the development of the Sparse Distributed Representation (SDR) classifier, which departs from the CLA method by combining maximum likelihood estimation with a feed-forward neural network. The SDR Classifier is implemented in this work utilizing Numenta's tried-and-true technique.

With changes to its weight matrix, the SDR Classifier outperforms its predecessor in continuous learning by rewarding correct predictions and punishing inaccurate ones. The learning approaches are used in this process. Sparse Distributed Representations (SDRs), which are essential to the cortex theory of intelligence, serve as the foundation for the SDR Classifier. Using HTM concepts to build overlapping SDRs that efficiently categorize data hierarchically, this method develops an algorithm for anomaly detection and classification.

The SDR Classifier's higher accuracy and efficiency compared to modern algorithms are demonstrated via evaluation across benchmark datasets. These outcomes highlight the SDR Classifier's effectiveness and demonstrate how widely applicable it is in a variety of fields.
