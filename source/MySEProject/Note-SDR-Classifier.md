# **Implementation of SDR Classifier in C#:**
The SDR (Sparse Distributed Representation) classifier is a machine learning algorithm that is used for pattern recognition and classification tasks. It is based on the theory of Hierarchical Temporal Memory (HTM) and uses sparse, distributed representations of the input data to learn and classify patterns.

Example of C# code for an SDR classifier:
https://github.com/wubie23/neocortexapi/blob/Wubishet/source/MySEProject/basicSDRClassifier.cs

This code creates a new SDR classifier with specified input and column dimensions, trains the classifier on a set of training data, and then classifies a new input. The classifier.Train(trainingData) method is used to train the classifier, and the classifier.Classify(input) method is used to classify new inputs.


**Note:**

This is a basic example and there is missing a lot of context, like the data loading, and it doesn't cover all the functionality that a real-world application would need.

Additionally, the package "Numenta.HTM" is open source package developed by Numenta, it's a C# implementation of the HTM theory, this package is not part of the .net core or .net framework, you need to install it via NuGet package manager.
